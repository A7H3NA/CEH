# Honeypot construction (T-Pot: 19.03.1)


The trial period of Splunk, which was linked with Glastopf, a Web HoneyPot that I made earlier, has expired.
I wanted to do more, and when I searched for HoneyPot, there was a full T-Pot.
I tried to install it referring to the articles of various people until last year, but it does not work at all!

* All of the installations of Ver17.10 were unsuccessful when trying to install them with a light feeling.
[The current version is 19.03, and the distribution method has changed from Ubuntu to Debian, so the installation method has also changed.

## Environment
* Server: Sakura VPS  
　CPU: 4 CPU  
　Memory: 4 GB  
　Storage: SSD 400 GB  
　Amount of money:  
　　Initial cost: 4000 yen ... SSD expansion cost  
　　Running cost: 3200 yen x 12 months ... Server usage fee  
* T-Pot: 19.03.1
* Proxy: Not used
* DHCP: Not used


## Build
* When install.sh was used, a debian distribution error occurred and the installation failed.  
Therefore, this time install from the ISO image.
 
* Get the T-pot ISO image from the following URL. (As of December 4, 2019)  
(The installation method is completely different depending on the version.)  
  https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce/releases/tag/19.03.1

* Sakura VPS can mount iso image with sftp, so mount it.  
(If VirtIO is enabled at this time, the T-Pot installation process will not proceed after the first reboot, so disable VirtIO.)

* When installation starts, the debian installer starts and the following process is executed.  
Debian OS installation → Reboot (first time) → T-Pot installation → Reboot (second time)

* Since IP allocation via DHCP fails on the way, manually set the IP address / subnet mask / default gateway / name server.

* Specify a blank for the proxy.

* When debian installation is complete, the first reboot will run.

* T-Pot installation starts after reboot.
⇒Selected “STANDARD” this time.

* Enter the tsec user password. (Enter twice including confirmation.)
![Link Text](https://github.com/A7H3NA/CEH/blob/master/Honeypot/T-Pot/1.install/T-Pot_install_005.jpg "tsec user")

* Enter the username and password of the web user. (You will be asked twice including confirmation.)
![Link Text](https://github.com/A7H3NA/CEH/blob/master/Honeypot/T-Pot/1.install/T-Pot_install_006.jpg "web user")

* After entering the user, T-Pot installation will start.
![Link Text](https://github.com/A7H3NA/CEH/blob/master/Honeypot/T-Pot/1.install/T-Pot_install_007.jpg "install start")

* Reboot occurs after installation is completed and T-Pot starts.

* Access the Dashboard with `https://<IP address>:64297`.
![Link Text](https://github.com/A7H3NA/CEH/blob/master/Honeypot/T-Pot/1.install/T-Pot_install_009.jpg "Dashboard")

* The [Monitoring] tab is initially stopped. When started, Elasticsearch and Kibana collection will start.

... and when accessing `https://<IP address>` to access Glastopf here, the Glastopf screen does not start.
I thought that the installation failed, and when I looked at tpotce / CHANGELOG.md of T-Pot, there was the following description.

> 20190601  
> Start supporting Fatt, remove Glastopf  
> Build Dockerfile, Adjust logstash, installer, update and such.  
> Glastopf is no longer supported within T-Pot  

How, Glastopf has already been removed from T-Pot.
It's a little lonely to start building HoneyPot from Glastopf.


## Feelings after Building
* Even if the operating environment is less than the necessary resources, it works without any problems.  
　✔ Insufficient memory capacity-No effect for now  
　✔ No DHCP-No impact on installation  

* If you ’re looking at the Dashboard for about 30 minutes, you ’re already at Cowrie and Dionaea.
The attack has begun and the number of attacks has increased.

* I would like to consider Elasticsearch log maintenance in the future because it takes up a lot of disk space.
