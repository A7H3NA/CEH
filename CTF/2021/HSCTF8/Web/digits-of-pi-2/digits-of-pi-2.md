The target spreadsheet reads values from an external spreadsheet called `1MD4O3pFoQY59_YoW_ZzxRUg-rBgHFlAaYxnNABmqc3A`.

The target spreadsheet has not been granted public permissions and access from the outside is prohibited, 
and it is not displayed in the reference range.

It is being read as a value in a fetchData request.
